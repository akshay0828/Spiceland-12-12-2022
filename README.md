## Project analysis and development
Task assigned: In general, the project has 3 main parts which is: Seller, Customer and Delivery Person. After discussions, finalized the features and organized data storage we separated the project into 3 main modules.
<br/>
Github was used to organized and sharing source code.


## Project Requirements
This is an engineering proof of concept. The goal is to exercise the Spring MVC/Boots technology according to “training” guidelines to validate its use in future projects. 

<p>
    <strong>The group consists of 5 members.</strong>
</p> 
 
_The main hours spent on the project for each person is expected to be ~30(?) hours. Every Team member is to “own” a “front to back” scenario - View, Controller, Domain Object, Validation, Service and Repository._

##### Here is the list of the techniques we include in our project as a Group.

## Technique 
<ul>
    <li>application.properties config</li>
    <li>JSP</li>
    <li>Bean Validation or Spring Validator</li>
    <li>Custom Validation Annotation</li>
    <li>Custom Formatter</li>
    <li>Uploading files</li>
    <li>Exception Handling (Individual, Globally)</li>
    <li>Spring Security (Database, Logout, etc)</li>
    <li>Security authorization – interceptor, AOP</li>
    <li>Persistence – Hibernate + Spring Data</li>
    <li>ONLY allow In memory database (H2, HSQL, etc)</li>
    <li>CSS Library</li>
    <li>GitHub</li>    
</ul>
